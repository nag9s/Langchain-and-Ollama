The concept that Earth orbits around the Sun can be understood through scientific theories such as heliocentrism, which suggests that the planets in our solar system move around the Sun due to gravity. In this context, the Sun is not considered a \"planet\" itself but rather the star at the center of our solar system. The Sun's position and energy output are essential for sustaining life on Earth, making it an integral part of our ecosystem.
